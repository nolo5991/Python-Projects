# Scatter Plot & SOS Analysis of User Feedback on AI-Generated Videos: Evaluating Video Appeal and Quality.

This analysis explores user feedback on AI-generated videos, focusing on two key aspects: Video Appeal and Video Quality. Using a combination of scatter plots and SOS (Standard Deviation of Scores) analysis, the plots display the relationship between the Mean Opinion Score (x-axis) and the Standard Deviation of Ratings (y-axis). Additionally, the parabolic equation derived from the SOS analysis offers insights into how user perceptions vary across these two dimensions. This analysis was conducted as part of the project "Evaluation of Text-to-Video AI Generators."
